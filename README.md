## Digit Recognition with Random Forest

This Python script trains a model to recognize images of numbers from the MNIST dataset using a Random Forest classifier, achieving around 97% accuracy.

### ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   (Use `python` instead of `python3` on Windows)

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SimonHumber/midterm-ai
   cd midterm-ai
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the script**

   ```bash
   python3 CPAN358_Midterm_Summer2025.py
   ```
